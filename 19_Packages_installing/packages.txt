In python we can install packages for helping us
To install a package, the first you need is a virtual environment, in this case venv

1. Create a venv from console (bash)
  $ py -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment

2. Activate the virtual environment
  $ source venv/bin/activate  (bash/zsh)
  $ venv/Scripts/activate.bat (cmd)

3. Install a package
  $ pip install <package_name>
